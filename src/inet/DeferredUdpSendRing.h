/**
 * Bounded FIFO queue with fixed-capacity storage indexed in a circle.
 *
 * This is one data structure, not two: logical behavior is a queue (enqueue at
 * the back, dequeue from the front). `head` and `count` map that queue onto a
 * fixed `FixedBuffer` by wrapping indices modulo `Capacity`, which is the
 * usual ring-buffer indexing trick for a fixed array.
 *
 * `PushBack` / `PopFront` are the standard names for enqueue/dequeue at the
 * two ends of that FIFO. A low-level ring API might expose only head/tail
 * indices; here we expose the queue operations callers need.
 *
 * After `PopFront`, the vacated cell is assigned `Slot{}` so the slot in the
 * array is empty until reused. That is optional for some `Slot` types once
 * moved-from, but it keeps array cells in a known state and matches types whose
 * moved-from state still holds resources until reassigned or destroyed.
 *
 * `PopFront` returns `Slot` by value: the returned object is constructed from
 * the slot contents (move), then returned to the caller (NRVO or move). It is
 * not a reference into ring storage; the caller owns the returned `Slot`.
 *
 * Storage mechanics are in this header so host unit tests can cover them
 * without LwIP.
