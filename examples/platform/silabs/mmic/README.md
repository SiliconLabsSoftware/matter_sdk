# mmic host build

Host-side build of the `mmic` serial shell. Supported on Linux and macOS.

## Prerequisites

- CMake >= 3.13
- A C11 compiler (clang or gcc)
- POSIX pthreads (already present on Linux/macOS)

## Build

From this directory:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

The resulting binary is `build/mmic_host`.

To force a specific compiler or build type:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
cmake --build build
```

### Transport selection (UART vs CPC)

By default `mmic_host` talks to the device over a UART.

To instead talk to the device through the Silicon Labs CPC (Co-Processor
Communication) daemon on **endpoint 90**, configure with:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DMMIC_USE_CPC=ON
cmake --build build
```

This requires the CPC daemon (`cpcd`) development files (`sl_cpc.h` and
`libcpc`) to be discoverable by CMake. If they live in a non-standard
location, point at them explicitly:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DMMIC_USE_CPC=ON \
    -DCPC_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/include \
    -DCPC_LIBRARY=/path/to/libcpc.so
```

## Run

### UART build (default)

Pass the serial device as the only argument.

Linux:

```sh
./build/mmic_host /dev/ttyUSB0
```

macOS:

```sh
./build/mmic_host /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX
```

The port is opened at 115200 8N1. Bytes received from the port are printed to
stdout. Type `exit` (or send EOF) to close the port and quit.

### CPC build (`-DMMIC_USE_CPC=ON`)

The `cpcd` daemon must already be running and bridging to the device.
Optionally pass the cpcd instance name (defaults to `cpcd_0`):

```sh
./build/mmic_host              # uses "cpcd_0"
./build/mmic_host cpcd_myrcp   # uses the named instance
```

`mmic_host` opens CPC endpoint 90 and exchanges the same framed
command/response bytes as in UART mode.

## Clean

```sh
rm -rf build
```
